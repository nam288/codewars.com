Create a regular expression capable of evaluating binary strings (which consist of only `1`'s and `0`'s) and determining whether the given string represents a number divisible by `7`.

Note:

Empty strings should be rejected.
Your solution should reject strings with any character other than `0` and `1`.
No leading `0`'s will be tested unless the string exactly denotes `0`.
